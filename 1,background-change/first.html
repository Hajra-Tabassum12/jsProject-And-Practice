    <p class="btnb">Brand image is the perception of the brand in the mind of the customer. It is an aggregate of beliefs, ideas, and impressions that a customer holds regarding the brand.

        An image is the set of beliefs, ideas, and impression that a person holds regarding an object.
        
        – Kotler
        A simple definition of brand image could be – the customers’ perception of the brand based on their interactions and experience with the brand or their beliefs of what the brand could be. 
        
        A brand can be perceived differently by different customers. Hence, the formation of a consistent brand image is a huge task for any business.
        
        Importance Of Brand Image
        Every Company strives to build a strong image as it helps in fulfilling their business motives. A strong brand image has the following advantages –
        
        More profits as new customers are attracted to the brand.
        Easy to introduce new products under the same brand.
        Boosts the confidence of existing customers. Helps in retaining them.
        Better Business-Customer relationship.
        A company with a bad image may struggle to operate and might not be able to launch a new product under the same brand.
        
        What Gives Rise To Brand Image?
        Companies spend most of their time, effort, and resources in building their brand identity. They decide how their brand will look, how should the customer feel when they contact the brand, where should the brand be located in consumers’ minds, and other associations. All these, when summed up, give rise to a brand personality which eventually gives rise to the brand image when the customer interacts with this brand or gets to know about it.
        
        Now, it is not always necessary that an image forms out of interactions and experience with the brand. There are times when prospective customers form an image of the brand in their mind after reading news about the brand or after watching an influencer review it.</p>
