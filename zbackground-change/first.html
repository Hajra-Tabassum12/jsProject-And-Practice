    <p>Progress is dependent upon how you and your team respond to change. Your team can passively accept change, 
        but not wholeheartedly embrace it; they can fight against it, or choose to give their all to make it work, even if they don’t agree with it. Teams that thrive during change are change compatible: they choose to take a productive approach to change, and
         embrace the challenges it may present regardless of how they feel about it.

         <p>Ultimately, change compatibility is about being flexible, but unfortunately, teams don’t always immediately respond in a flexible manner. In fact, teams usually respond to change in one of three ways
             with rigidity, with complacency or with flexibility. As you review each of these three responses, keep your own team in mind and think about which response is most common
             .</p>

        <p>
            When rigidity is displayed, change is avoided. The team, or some of its members, focus their energy and attitude on the reasons why the change is a bad idea. If within the team’s power, the change may be derailed; if not, negative attitudes and lack of support for the change not only hinder the effective implementation, but create increased stress, frustration and disengagement.

        Here’s an example. A group of nurses I worked with were frustrated with a recent change imposed upon them and they were adamant that they would not adopt the new policy until they were forced to do it, and even then, they would “go down fighting.” When I asked why they were resisting the change, the responses included:
